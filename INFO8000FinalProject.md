The datasets I obtained is from our computational plant science lab. We sampled one common bean genotype L88-57 from two environments: water stress and well-watered for about 650 plants. We dug out  and took image of each root and then the images were processed by DIRT platform on Cyverse. 
I have one file of root traits under water stress, one file of root traits under well-water and one file of biomass(dryweight of aboveground) data that consist of L88-57 with other species. The reasons I choose this dataset are:
It is raw real data taken by several different people, which contains several wrong entries.
It has several files, which needs reformatting and cleaning
It satifies 10/1 ratio requirement. 
The questions can be studied from this dataset:
1. How drought  affect root traits and biomass in common bean?
2. Can we pridict if the common bean has underwent water stress based on their root traits or biomass data?
